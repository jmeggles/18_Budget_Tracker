  ## Motivation
  Trackers help people keep info for reference.  It's not easy remembering how or where money is spent so this tracker will help give a timeline of income vs outcome so you know how much your spending and what's in the bank.  Not only does this work online, but offline as well!  So, no probelm if you lose internet connection, it will include entries either way and when back on line, the database is updated with all entries. 

  ## Installation 
  No installation needed.  Open with this link [Heroku](https://budget-tracker-for-you.herokuapp.com/).

  ## How_to_use
  Follow link to deploy app and enter the name of a transaction, then the amount, click either subtract funds if you spent money or add funds if you received income.
