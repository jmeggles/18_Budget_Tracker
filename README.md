  ## Motivation
  Trackers help people keep info for reference.  It's not eady remembering where money goes so this tracker will help give you a timeline of income vs outcome so you know how much your spending and what's in the bank.  Not only does this work online, but offline as well!  So, no probelm if you lose internet connection, it will include entries either way and when back on line, the database is updated with all entries.
